Well... that was easy! 


## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to web Scraping Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* A primer on some technologies we're going to use

## Web Scraping

### What is it?
I usually describe it as using a program to get data from the web by pulling content without an API(Application Program Interface).

Many sites have APIs you can connect to and use to pull data from.  Such as the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html). This is great! But sometimes you need data from a site that doesn't have an API. Thats what we're going to look at in this workshop. A lot of weather data can usually be pulled from an API.


### Where is it used?

Really any where you think it would be appriate to gather data. 

Some people I've met have built web scraper to look for jobs & find apartments.

Companies may search for email or contact information

Competitive analysis on a competing company, what prices do they have?

Realtors may scrape housing listings

Understand sentiment and words in reviews

Anytime you want data!


## Before we build

### HTML Basics
	Tags
	
	Inspect elements for planning

### Python

We're going to be using python to do our web scraping.

Don't worry if you've never programmed in python or at all before, I will explain concepts along the way. And if you want me to repeat something just ask! We'll be doing an intro to python course in January too if you want to go deeper!

##### Requests

##### Beautiful Soup

We will use Beautiful Soup is used to parse HTML and extract the information we need.


##### Pandas

##### Google Colab


## Lets scrape data from the web!
